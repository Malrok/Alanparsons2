This is my first attempt to create a program using LibGDX, aiming at having a proper game on Android.

This game project takes the form of a shooter, with some uncommon gameplay ideas I had, which may exist somewhere else but I never came across.
Mainly the game will consist in moving around an enemy "boss" spaceship, with the goal on every level to destroy that so called boss.

Hopefully my lack of talent in drawing and creating music wont be spotted by users :)
